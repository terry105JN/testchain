Sample Blockchain created using C++ as a precursor to the creation of a ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum Network.

## Description
As covered by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain), Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
